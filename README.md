Welcome to my University of Utah course repository!  
This repo is a collection of all my class projects, labs, and experiments across multiple graduate-level CS courses.  
It’s a mix of serious assignments and some *funny* side experiments I couldn’t resist trying. A
mix of **algorithms, systems, mobile apps, and some creative chaos**.
