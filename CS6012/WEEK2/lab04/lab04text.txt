Part 1
Two tests fail for arr2 because the binarySearch method incorrectly uses the index (mid) instead of the value at that index (arr[mid]). The goal is to check whether the target value exists in the array, not to compare the target with the index.
It is returning false when it should be true.
In binarySearch, the method which passed mid was the index number. However, the goal is to find the actual number in the array. So edit the code like arr[mid] could fix it.
Loop2 and loop3 appear to be infinite.
In loop2, the condition was b < 10. Since b = 0 and the only equation for b was b *= a, 0*= any number maintain 0. The condition will never satisfy; In loop3, same that the condition was a>c. However, in the loop, only the value of a was increment but not c. The condition will never meet as well.
The call to password.split(" â€œ) is to divide each character by space and ignore the space.
The correct password is 1 4 9 16 25
